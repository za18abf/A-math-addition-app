Mobile computing CW1


This project was based on a mobile app that is intended for preschool education purposes using Android studio. The app helps children to learn how to perform an addition operation in math and the message you should send across to the users is that the addition of two numbers can be operated by counting the total number of objects that each of the two numbers refers to. The theme I choose for this project was based on a cartoon called "SpongeBob SquarePants".
